                <h3>About Music Nepal</h3>
                <p>
                  Music Nepal was established in 1982, under the Industrial Act
                  of Nepal, as the first music industry in the country. It
                  pioneered the concept of royalty payments to artists and
                  creators of music by paying a fixed percentage of sales
                  revenue of their albums. This encouraged creation and helped
                  in the exponential growth of the industry. The growth was
                  driven especially by the popularity of Dohori and Folk Songs
                  of different parts of the country. Music Nepal also played a
                  catalytic role in developing Copyright Law and over the years
                  has joined hands with numerous stake holders to strengthen the
                  copyright regime in the country.

                <h3>More About Music Nepal</h3>
                <p>
                  After the collapse of physical sales of music-cassettes and
                  CDs, Music Nepal spearheaded change by retailing its contents
                  in different forms such as Ring Back Tones in mobile and full
                  length songs on various digital platforms including ITunes,
                  Spotify, Sony Music, YouTube, and more recently through its
                  own App named MOMO. It also evolved to diversify its product
                  offerings to cover music videos, television serials and
                  movies. Today, Music Nepal has alliances with several other
                  music companies for digital marketing of their songs, videos
                  and personal ring back tones (PRBTs) globally and accounts for
                  three quarter of the music market in the country. It also
                  hosts the largest number of music and related contents which
                  includes volumes of original songs of different genres in
                  Nepali and various regional languages and a sizable collection
                  of videos in digital format. With more than four decades of
                  quality service, continuous improvement and sincere
                  dedication, Music Nepal has established itself as the
                  undisputed market leader in the music business in Nepal.
